# Apartment price analysis - Bubble vulnerability in Korea by region and size

This analysis measures the vulnerability of apartment price (average) in Korea - by region and size of apartment - to the latest real estate bubble formed by massive money supply hike in late 2019 following COVID-19 outbreak. The bubble vulnerability score uses three following correlation coefficients:

① Price - Money supply change rate 2 months ago (%, YoY)

② Price - Base interest rate of Bank of Korea 2 months ago

③ Price - Money supply balance 2 months ago (Tril. KRW)

The word "bubble" here means that the apartment prices rose not due to the rise in apartments' value itself and attraction of more demand, but just due to excessive supply of money in the market as a method to support the economy struck by COVID-19.
And "vulnerability" means the prices are likely to fall rapidly if money is withdrawn from the market by raising base interest rate or quantitative tapering.
