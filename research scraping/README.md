# Google web scraping in use - Research project at a consulting firm

The purpose of this project is basically to show that I can write a simple code to scrape a lot of information when necessary.
I wrote this Python code, used it and got the final result in an Excel file within less than half a day.

I haven't worked at a consulting firm but I did the work because I was asked by a friend of mine who works at one to:
- find major online supplement shops in each of the countries she wanted to take a look into
- put them on a list with columns 'country', 'company name', 'HQ location (country)' and 'link to website'

Of course, the CSV file created at the end of the uploaded Python code was not the final result I sent her.
The CSV file was just a preliminary result I could get the clean final result out of.
