- Among the correlations above, the first two which take population as x-variable have too broad a band. Population alone doesn't seem to have enough influence on price.\n","### - Most of the 'House supply - Price change' correlation coefficients are too close to 0\n","\n","## ∴ Therefore, for further analysis and presentation with Power BI, I am going to use only 1) base interest rate, 2) money supply balance and 3) money supply change rate as x-variables.\n","\n","## ∴ Also, I am not going to use price change rate but only going to use price as y-variable because:\n","- When I got the Month over Month change rate of two of the aforementioned x-variables, Korean base interest rate and money supply balance, to pair and analyze with Month over Month price change rate, the p-values were too high (see codes below)\n","- Likewise, I converted current price change rate data from Month over Month based to Year over Year based in order to synchronize with one of the x-variables above, money supply change rate (Month over Month based), the p-values were too high (see codes below)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"494f3158","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.223269Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.222842Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.267943Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.266678Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.065446,"end_time":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.270481","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-29T12:00:55.205035","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style
